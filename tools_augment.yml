  # Hotspots: Areas requiring special attention
  hotspots:
    - path: merger/wc-merger/merge_core.py
      reason: "Complex branching logic with multiple profile modes"
      severity: "medium"
      lines: [1000, 1100]
    
    - path: merger/wc-merger/wc-merger.py
      reason: "UI state management and Pythonista-specific code"

  # Suggestions: Architectural recommendations
  suggestions:
    - "Consider extracting profile logic into strategy pattern classes"
    - "Add comprehensive unit tests for health and organism layers"
    - "Document the relationship between merge_core and wc-extractor"
    - "Consider splitting merge_core.py into smaller modules"
  
  # Risks: Known issues or concerns
  risks:
    - "Large merges may exhaust Pythonista memory on iOS"
    - "Multi-part merges need proper header normalization"
    - "Delta reports depend on wc-extractor being available"
